## An unknown boulder, right in town?
I hike from time to time just to look at and look for boulders. It helps me plan climbing days, find new lines, and keep my legs in shape.

I certainly did not have any hopes of finding new lines in Pie Shop main, but I had Ground Control (V11), Diamonds are Forever (V10), and Dr. Ticklestone (V9) on my list to check out, so I set out on such a hiking day at Pie Shop. 

When you arrive at Dr. Ticklestone, which is a beauty in itself, your eye will inevitably be drawn to the massive boulder just uphill.

This particular boulder is not included in the guidebook. Given it's in a well-traveled area close to town, I thought this could only mean one thing - it was not climbable? 

Yet I could see some hold options on the left side of the boulder, though they looked difficult.  The question was, could they lead rightwards onto the main face or leftwards to the arete by the tree? 

I climbed up the backside and found one old bolt on top. I could imagine the old school trying to top-rope it.  So was it possible? Could I boulder it?

In these situations I have to confirm for myself, rather than assuming the obvious conclusion (that it was impossible, or else it would already have be done). I soon returned with a rope for inspection.  

## The climb unfolds

At first glance, you'll notice the standing start crimps are beautiful, golden and begged to be climbed! Too good to be true, really.

I painstakingly confirmed there were not enough holds above the scoop and mini roof.  But the holds which trended left towards the arete had potential. I began to work the moves and completed the lower moves in isolation in two sessions.

The climb starts on a adequate left hand sidepull and a make-believe right hand sloper. You then make a large move to a small crimp. And move up to two better crimps just above.

From this crimp pair, it's arguably the crux sequence through side-pulls and compression.

Gain the large undercling side-pull feature with a good foot rail. Tiny crimps will get you high enough to gain a good piece of patina, from which you can rocket up and gain the layback, narrowly avoiding the tree. Amazing!

## It all comes together 
### When the impossible becomes possible
When I realized that this climb was possible from a sit start, I couldn't believe the luck of it.  This boulder is certainly everything I seek out.  Good rock and setting.  A variety of holds and movement.  Tall, but not death defying thanks to positive holds that come just at the right height.

It did not matter to me whether it had been climbed or not. It deserved to be climbed, and the moves felt within reach. 
### Snow and winter coming in fast
Unfortunately the snow storms came in after I unlocked the beta. I knew that winter could drag on for another month or two, and I couldn't stand the thought of waiting.  

The good news was that this boulder might be the first boulder to melt out in South Lake. But the bad news was that the approach was still very snowy, and the parking for pie shop was completely snowed-in with four foot snow banks.  
### Committing to it
I was inspired and decided to commit to an attempt. I spent a few hours digging out a parking space, knowing I could give the climb another try just before the Christmas holidays and another predicted storm.  The backside of the climb was still snowy, but I figured I could slide off the backside and drop off into the thick snow bank below. 

After several rest days, I put on my snowshoes and shuttled twice to get three pads up to the climb. A truly aerobic workout!

After quite a bit of warming up, I had a few good initial attempts but fell several times trying to reach the slanting undercling feature. While no move is stopper, there are plenty of difficult moves and they build into a hefty sequence!
### Through the narrows

I felt my grip strength and the chance to send slipping away.  I rewatched some prior beta attempt videos, and decided to modify foot beta.  I set the clock and rested for a half hour. 

One more attempt -  I barely held on through the opening sequence. It was an out-of body experience committing to a high step with the tree close behind me, and reaching a high-point on the arete. 

I was tired, but I knew the top eased up.  I took my time and navigated the arete to the top. 

I had pulled off an ascent, the first ascent it would seem.

As predicted, I had to take my shoes off and drop into the snow on the backside of the boulder.  Brrr!


## Final thoughts
### No known ascents
I reached out to some locals to try to get history of this climb.  As best as we could determine, there are no known ascents. Again, I don't care so much if this is a first ascent.  If anything, I just think it's crazy this thing isn't a sought after classic. I've referred to it as The Narrows. 

### Estimating difficulty
My estimate from the grade considers that the climb seemed at least as difficult as Pimp Juice Sit (V9), which I sent most immediately before this climb. About a week after the send of the Narrows, I also did Diamonds are Forever (V10) for some grade comparison.  I did Diamonds in a single session, which gives me more confidence in my estimate. The Narrows sequence in my mind is just as or nearly as hard, but may not be for someone who is taller.

### Go try it

Consensus will come in time, so let's just say if this is in your general ballpark go give it a try and throw in your opinion!  If you're like me and seek out aesthetic boulders with many moves, this is hands-down a top-shelf Tahoe boulder.  Dare I say, even Collectors Edition? It is so extremely rare for a boulder such as this one to exist, and I'm grateful for the magical days it gave me.
